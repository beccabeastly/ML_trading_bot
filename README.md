# Code Footnotes
After running both the SMA and Logistic Regression models I was able to print the prediciton tables. For the logistic regression model I adjusted the data from 3 months (SMA model) to 1 month. As shown below, this caused the model to be less accurate.

When adjusting the logistic Regression to 3 months the LR model became more accurate but still less accuarate than the SMA model.

This graph shows the more accurate Logistic Regression model (3 months).
